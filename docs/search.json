    "text": "About me\nSome people find their passion through silence — I found mine through conversation. From that childhood moment when my teacher told my parents, “Kunal talks to everyone,” I realized connection was my superpower. Over time, I’ve learned that meaningful communication isn’t just about talking — it’s about understanding how people, data, and decisions all interact.\nToday, I’m pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University, learning to turn data into clear, impactful stories. My coursework and projects span from spatial data analysis and reproducibility in R to storytelling through Quarto reports. What excites me most is bridging the gap between analytics and communication — transforming technical insights into narratives that people can actually act on.\nOutside of study and work, I’m a proud Indian with an explorer’s heart. I love discovering new cities, foods, and perspectives — and I’m at my happiest when surrounded by family, friends, or a good debate. Life, to me, is about continuous learning, collaboration, and keeping curiosity alive — whether in a dataset or a conversation."
