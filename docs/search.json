    "text": "Why It Matters Now\nDelta’s story isn’t history — it’s a warning.\nEvery new variant tests the same question: Are we protected, or just lucky?\nThe takeaway:\n\nDelta multiplied breach risk by about 2½×.\nTo restore safety, we need ≥60% blocking efficacy and ≥80% coverage.\nCoverage alone is not the cure; adaptability is.\n\nAs new variants come, the real measure of safety won’t be walls or rules —\nit’ll be how quickly we learn to rebuild them."
