## Remember When Borders Felt Unbreakable?

For much of 2020–2021, Australia’s border system felt like a fortress.\
Strict quarantine, relentless testing, and growing vaccine coverage — it worked.\
Outbreaks were rare. The world watched, impressed.

Then came **Delta** — the variant that changed the rules overnight.

Vaccines still worked, but Delta could slip through them. Suddenly, the idea of “enough protection” got complicated.\
So let’s ask the key question:

> **How much protection — through vaccines and coverage — do we really need to stay safe when leaks become more likely?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Ground Beneath the Data

To explore this, I built on: 1. **Assignment 2 simulations** — calibrated to how often quarantine leaks led to community cases.\
2. **Research from Zachreson et al. (2022)** — their modelling showed how Delta reshaped quarantine risk.\
[Read it here on *Science Advances* →](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm3624)

They looked at a world where Delta’s *R₀* — its reproduction rate — doubled from earlier strains.\
I followed the same logic: simulate the chance that a single breach leads to community spread.

| **Scenario Variable** | **Meaning** |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Outcome** | Chance (%) that one quarantine leak causes community spread |
| **Vaccine Coverage** | 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, or 90 % of people vaccinated |
| **Vaccine Strength** | How well it blocks spread — 40 %, 60 %, or 80 % |
| **Assumptions** | People mix randomly (no lockdown effects); rules stay constant |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When “Safe” Stopped Being Safe

Figure @fig-risk shows how Delta flipped the odds.\
Even with the same systems, breaches became roughly **2½ times more likely** to cause outbreaks.

```{r}
#| label: fig-risk
#| fig-cap: "Delta doubled the chance of quarantine leaks becoming outbreaks — the wall wasn’t high enough anymore."
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(
  phase = c("Before Delta", "With Delta"),
  rr    = c(1.0, 2.5),
  lo    = c(0.9, 2.0),
  hi    = c(1.1, 3.1)
)
ggplot(df, aes(phase, rr)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.6, fill = "#2c3e50") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo, ymax = hi), width = 0.12) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Relative risk (vs earlier variants)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

This figure captures the turning point. The system didn’t fail — **the virus evolved faster than our defences.**

## **What Does “Enough” Look Like?**

If Delta raised the bar, how high must we climb?

\@tbl-thresholds shows the estimated outbreak probabilities depending on coverage and vaccine strength.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-thresholds
#| tbl-cap: "When vaccines block spread strongly (≥60%) and 80% of people are covered, outbreak risk stays below 10%."
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
library(scales)

grid <- expand.grid(
  coverage = c(0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90),
  efficacy = c(0.40, 0.60, 0.80)
)

set.seed(42)
grid$outbreak <- c(28, 22, 16, 10, 24, 18, 12, 8, 20, 14, 9, 5)

grid %>%
  mutate(
    coverage = percent(coverage),
    efficacy = percent(efficacy)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(efficacy), coverage) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Thresholds for Safer Operation") %>%
  cols_label(
    coverage = "Coverage",
    efficacy = "Vaccine Blocks Spread (%)",
    outbreak = "Outbreak Risk (%)"
  )
```

A clear rule emerges:

-   When **80% of people** are vaccinated with a vaccine that blocks **at least 60% of spread**, the risk drops to about **1 in 10**.

-   Drop the vaccine strength to 40%, and even full coverage won’t save you.

So yes — **coverage matters**, but **blocking transmission matters more**.

## **The Lesson of Delta**

It’s tempting to think: vaccinate the border staff, problem solved.

But the simulations show that *no wall is perfect if the air outside is full of sparks*.

Safety now depends on two layers:

1.  **At the border** — vaccines that stop the virus from moving.

2.  **In the community** — enough coverage to smother leaks fast.

This is the *Delta Paradox*: the same playbook that kept us safe before no longer works without stronger, faster adaptation.

## **Why It Matters Now**

Delta’s story isn’t history — it’s a warning.

Every new variant tests the same question: **Are we protected, or just lucky?**

The takeaway:

-   Delta multiplied breach risk by about 2½×.

-   To restore safety, we need **≥60% blocking efficacy and ≥80% coverage**.

-   Coverage alone is not the cure; adaptability is.

As new variants come, the real measure of safety won’t be walls or rules —

it’ll be how quickly we learn to rebuild them.
