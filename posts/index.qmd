### ✍️ About This Space

This blog is a public journal of my learning journey in data communication. Each post started as a class assignment, then evolved into a story that anyone can read — even without a statistics degree.

Here’s what I try to do with every post: - Focus on clarity first — no jargon walls. - Let visuals do some of the explaining. - Keep it short enough to finish with your morning coffee. ☕

I write mainly about data, design, and decision-making — but occasionally about the process of learning itself.
