### ✍️ About This Space

This blog is a small collection of what I’ve learned about turning data into stories.

Each post began as a class project, but I’ve rewritten them so anyone can follow along — no statistics background needed.

I try to

-   Keep things clear and easy to read

-   Use visuals to make ideas click

-   Keep posts short enough to enjoy with a cup of coffee ☕

Most of what I write is about **data, communication, and decision-making**, but sometimes it’s also about the learning process — what works, what doesn’t, and what I’m figuring out along the way.
